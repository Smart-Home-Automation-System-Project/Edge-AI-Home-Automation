## üîå Sensor Module Installation (ESP32)

Follow these steps to set up a sensor module for the Edge AI Home Automation System using an ESP32 board:

1. Flash MicroPython on the ESP32

    - Install MicroPython firmware on your ESP32.
    - Refer to the official [MicroPython tutorial for ESP32](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html) for detailed instructions.

2. Upload Required Files

- Copy the following files to the ESP32‚Äôs local storage using a tool like Thonny or ampy:
    - `boot.py`
    - `main.py`
    - `webserver.py`

3. Configure the Device

- You can generate a unique `client_id` and update `main.py` using any text editor
- Connect the sensor pins according to the provided wiring diagram.

4. Connect to Configuration Interface

- Restart the module. It will create a Wi-Fi access point named: `SensorModule`.
- Connect your computer or phone to this access point.
- Open a browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1.

5. Join Home Network

- On the configuration page, enter your home Wi-Fi credentials.
- Once connected, the sensor will automatically appear in the ‚ÄúAdd Sensor‚Äù page of the [Edge-AI-Home-Automation](https://github.com/Smart-Home-Automation-System-Project/Edge-AI-Home-Automation) will show your new sensor with it's `client_id`.

6. Final Setup

- Select the newly detected sensor using its `client id`.
- Assign a friendly name and add it to your system.
