=== CO2 control ====
if (CO2 level >=  1000) => turn on exhaust fan
      (CO2 level <= 800  ) => turn off
     (800 < CO2 level <1000) => fan state stays as is [a buffer zone to  prevent fan from being tuned on/off imdediately]

=== smoke control ==== (smoke generated from fire hazards and cooking)
if (smoke density > threshold_smoke) and (co_level < threshold_co): # co - carbon monoxide
   # smoke generated from cooking
   turn on exhaust fan

if (smoke density > threshold_smoke) and (co_level > threshold_co):
   # Fire smoke
   turn on exhaust fan
   trigger an alarm
   send email alerts using firebase #

=== gas leak detection=====
if gas_level >= gas_threshold:
    # Gas leak detected, take actions
    turn_off_gas_appliances()  # Signal to turn off gas appliances
    close_gas_valve()          # Signal to close the gas valve
    turn_on_exhaust_fan()      # Turn on exhaust fan to vent the gas
    trigger_alarm()            # Sound the alarm for immediate action
    send_email_alerts() using firebase
